  "header": "# Grid system",
  "headerText": "Vuetify comes with a 12 point grid system built using <kbd>flex-box</kbd>. The grid is used to create specific layouts within an application's content.  It contains 5 types of media breakpoints that are used for targeting specific screen sizes or orientations, **xs**, **sm**, **md**, **lg** and **xl**. These resolutions are defined below in the Viewport Breakpoints table and can be modified by customizing the [Breakpoint service](/customization/breakpoints).",
  "examples": {
    "usage": {
      "desc": "The `v-container` can be used for a center focused page, or given the `fluid` prop to extend its full width. `v-row` is used as a wrapper for the `v-col` component. The structure of your layout will be as follows, **v-container** &raquo; **v-row** &raquo; **v-col**. Each part of the grid chain is a flex-box element."

      "header": "### Offset",
      "desc": "Offsets are useful for compensating for elements that may not be visible yet, or to control the position of content. Just as with breakpoints, you can set an offset for any available sizes. This allows you to fine tune your application layout precisely to your needs."

      "desc": "By default, flex components will automatically fill the available space in a row or column. They will also shrink relative to the rest of the flex items in the flex container when there isn't enough space in the row or column. To disable the grow behavior, use the `shrink` attribute. To disable the shrink behavior, use the `grow` attribute. To disable both the grow and shrink behavior, use the `grow-shrink-0` attribute."
